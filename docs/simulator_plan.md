- Phase 1: Data Collection Strategy
    - Data Sources
        - 1. Application Metrics (from our test app):
            Request rate, error rate, latency (frontend/backend)
            CPU/Memory usage per service
            Throughput calculations
        - 2. Kubernetes Metrics:
            Pod counts, replica sets
            Node resource utilization
            Network I/O
        - 3. Fault Injection Events:
            Timestamp and type of injected fault
            Duration and severity parameters
    - Data Collection Implementation
        - 1. data_collector implementation
        - 2. fault_injector implementation
- Phase 2: Data Storage and Management
    - Storage Strategy
        We'll use a hybrid approach:
        - 1. Real-time: Keep recent data in memory for immediate access
        - 2. Long-term: Store historical data in Parquet files for training
    - Storage Implementation
        - 1. Implement metrics collection service
        - 2. Set up fault injection framework
        - 3. Create data storage system
- Phase 3: Dynamics Model Architecture
    - Model Selection Criteria
        - 1. Temporal dependencies: Must handle time-series data
        - 2. Multi-output regression: Predict multiple metrics simultaneously
        - 3. Interpretability: Should learn physically plausible dynamics
    - Model Implementation
- Phase 4: Training Pipeline
    - Training Strategy
        - 1. Supervised learning: Predict next state given current state and action
        - 2. Curriculum learning: Start with simple scenarios, progress to complex ones
        - 3. Online learning: Continuously update model with new data    
    - Model training implementation
        - 1. Implement and train the Transformer model
        - 2. Create data preprocessing pipeline
        - 3. Initial model validation
- Phase 5: Gym Environment Implementation
    - 1. Implement the custom Gym environment
    - 2. Integrate dynamics model
    - 3. Test action effects and reward function
- Phase 6: Validation and Testing Framework
    - Validation Strategy
        - 1. Model accuracy: Compare predictions against held-out test data
        - 2. Physical plausibility: Ensure predictions follow system dynamics
        - 3. RL agent performance: Benchmark against simple heuristics
    - Validation Framework
        - 1. Implement comprehensive testing
        - 2. Benchmark against baselines
        - 3. Iterate on model improvements
